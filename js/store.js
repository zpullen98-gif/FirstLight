/* First Light — persistence.

   The artifact this app was rebuilt from wrote every kept quote, every checked
   goal, and the morning count through `window.storage.get/set` — the claude.ai
   artifact API. In an ordinary browser that object does not exist, the call threw,
   and the catch quietly parked the value in a plain object that died on refresh.
   Nothing the reader did was ever saved, and nothing ever said so.

   So: localStorage is the real home, one versioned key, one JSON blob. Every
   access is wrapped, and a write that genuinely fails raises an event instead of
   returning as if it had worked.

   SCHEMA RULE — additive only. Never rename or repurpose a field. Readers have a
   year of mornings in here and a rename silently orphans all of it. To change a
   meaning, add a new field and migrate in bootMigrate(). */
