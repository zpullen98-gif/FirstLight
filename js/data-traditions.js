/* First Light — the seven chambers.

   One entry per tradition whose scripture the Library holds. Each is written to
   orient a reader who is standing in front of a strange book and does not know what
   kind of thing they are holding: what it is, who made it, what its words mean, how
   its people actually live, and how to begin reading without being lost.

   VOICE. Each tradition is presented as it understands itself, in its own terms,
   without ranking and without the flattening move of saying they all teach the same
   thing. They do not. Where they genuinely converge, the threads in data-threads.js
   put the passages side by side and let the reader see it; where they diverge, that
   is said plainly too. Dates follow mainstream scholarship rather than traditional
   attribution, and where the two differ the difference is stated rather than hidden.

   Fields: works[] are ids in FL_LIBRARY. concepts/figures/branches/practices/

  opening: [
    'Hinduism is the least like a religion of anything in this library, if by religion you mean a founder, a creed, and a date. It has none of those. What it has is the oldest continuously recited body of sacred verse on earth, and a family of traditions that have argued with one another inside it for three thousand years without ever needing to expel the losers.',
    'The Rig Veda is the base layer: 1,028 hymns to fire, dawn, storm, and the ordering principle of things, composed in an archaic Sanskrit that was already ancient when the Buddha was born, and carried for centuries entirely by voice, with a system of memorisation so exact that scholars can still reconstruct the pitch. The Upanishads are the second layer, and they turn sharply inward — from the sacrifice on the altar to the self that performs it, asking what, underneath everything, a person actually is. The Bhagavad Gita is the third: a conversation on a battlefield between a soldier who does not want to fight and a god driving his chariot, and the most widely read Hindu text in the world.',
    'The tradition holds all three at once without embarrassment. It has room for strict non-dualists who hold that the self and the absolute are one thing seen twice, and for devotees who would rather taste sugar than be sugar, and for villagers whose practice is a lamp lit at dusk for a deity in a niche.'

  reading: 'Do not begin with the Rig Veda. It is the oldest and the strangest, and read cold it is a wall of fire-altar imagery in a world you have no map of. Begin with the Gita, which is short, dramatic, and asks a question you already have: what do you do when every available action costs something. Then the Upanishads, for the turn inward. Then the Rig Veda, once you can hear it as the archaic poetry it is — and read it in small pieces, aloud if you can.'

The other half is the oral tradition eventually written down as Mishnah and Talmud: centuries of argument about what the text requires, preserving the minority opinions alongside the majority, on the principle that a rejected argument may be needed later.

A man of the warrior class left his household, tried the severest asceticism available for six years, found it did not work, ate a meal, sat down under a tree, and afterwards described what he had understood as four true things about suffering: that it exists, that it has a cause, that the cause can cease, and that there is a path.',
    'The Dhammapada is the most read text of the Pali canon and the best door into it: 423 verses of practical instruction, sharp and concrete, on anger, heedlessness, craving, and the discipline of one’s own mind. It is a small part of an enormous library — the Tripiṭaka, "three baskets", of monastic rule, discourse, and analysis — but almost everything essential is in it somewhere.',
    'Notice what the tradition does not require. There is no creator god at its centre, no soul in the sense the West means, and the Buddha is not a saviour but a physician who leaves you the prescription. The Kalama Sutta explicitly tells hearers not to accept a teaching on authority, on scripture, or on logic alone, but to test whether it leads to harm.'

    'The Analects is not a treatise. It is fragments — a question from a student, a remark on a walk, a comment on someone’s conduct — with no argument connecting them and no system on offer. Read straight through it can feel like eavesdropping.

    'Whether it is a religion at all is genuinely disputed, including inside China. It has no creator god and says almost nothing about an afterlife — asked about serving the spirits, Confucius replied that if you cannot yet serve people, how can you serve spirits.

  reading: 'Do not start at Genesis and grind forward; that plan has defeated more readers than any other book in this library. Start with the Gospel of Mark — it is the shortest, the earliest, and moves at a run. Then Luke for the parables, then John, which is doing something quite different. Then Genesis and Exodus. Save Revelation for last and read it as the coded resistance literature it is, not as a timetable.'

  epigraph: ['In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.', 'The Basmala'],

  opening: [
    'Islam is the insistence that there is one God and no other, that this has been said by every prophet from Adam onward, and that Muhammad is the last of them. Muslims do not regard it as a new religion but as the original one, restated after drift.',
    'The Qur’an is understood as the speech of God, revealed in Arabic over twenty-three years, and this changes what a translation is: the English here is a reading aid, not the Qur’an. It is not arranged as narrative and does not tell a story from beginning to end. Its 114 surahs run roughly longest to shortest, so the reader who starts at the front meets the most demanding material first, and its power is bound up with sound — it is meant to be heard, and millions have it entirely by heart.',
    'The practice is famously concrete. Five prayers at fixed times that reorganise the day around God; a month of daylight fasting; a fixed share of wealth given annually; a pilgrimage where every distinction of rank is stripped down to two pieces of white cloth. Alongside the Qur’an stands the hadith, the recorded sayings and conduct of the Prophet, sifted by an elaborate science of transmission.'

  reading: 'Do not begin at surah 2. The order is roughly by length, not chronology or difficulty, and the second surah is one of the longest and most legally dense in the book. Begin with al-Fatiha, the seven-verse opening, then read the short surahs at the very end — 93 through 114 — which are the earliest revealed, brief, and close to poetry. Then Yusuf (12), the one sustained narrative. Then work outward. And if you can, hear it recited once; the text assumes it.'
