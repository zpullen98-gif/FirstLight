/* First Light — the threads.

   One question, and what each tradition in the Library says about it, in its own
   words, with the citation attached so any of it can be checked.

   THE EDITORIAL RULE, because it is easy to get this wrong and the whole thing is
   worthless if it is got wrong: a thread is not an argument that everyone secretly
   agrees. Several of these end in genuine disagreement, and where they do, the
   closing note says so rather than smoothing it. The Golden Rule really does appear
   almost everywhere and that is remarkable; the nature of the self really is a
   dispute, and pretending otherwise would flatter the reader and insult the
   traditions. Passages are quoted whole where possible and never trimmed to remove
   a qualifier that inconveniences the theme.

   Translations are the public-domain ones the Library ships, so a reader who follows
   a citation lands on exactly these words. */

{ id: 'golden-rule',
  title: 'Do not do to others',
  question: 'Is there one rule underneath all the others?',
  intro: 'This is the strongest case for convergence in the whole library. The same rule, in nearly the same words, arrived independently in China, India, Greece, Palestine and Arabia across a span of a thousand years. Notice as you read that the older formulations are almost all negative — do not do — and that this is not a weaker version. It is a more careful one: refraining is something you can actually do to everyone, all the time.',

Laozi declines the symmetry entirely: goodness is not a response to be earned but a way of proceeding, extended to people who have not extended it to you. Confucius, asked whether one should repay injury with kindness, answered no — repay injury with justice, and kindness with kindness. Two Chinese teachers, a century apart, in flat contradiction. The tradition kept both.'

{ id: 'suffering',
  title: 'What suffering is for',
  question: 'Is pain meaningful, or only real?',
  intro: 'Here the traditions genuinely part. Every one of them acknowledges that living hurts. What they say next — whether the hurt is instructive, illusory, deserved, redemptive, or simply the price of being attached to a world that moves — differs so much that the answers cannot all be true.',

  ],
  close: 'Job is the honest one, and the reason his book is in the canon at all. Three friends arrive to explain his suffering with the standard theology — you must have deserved it — and the book\'s verdict is that they are wrong and have spoken falsely about God. No explanation is ever given to Job. He is shown the wild ass and the storehouses of snow, and that is the answer. Any tradition that claims to have solved this should be read against that book.'

{ id: 'death',
  title: 'Numbering the days',
  question: 'How should a person hold their own death?',
  intro: 'Not one of these traditions advises you to avoid the subject. Every one of them prescribes deliberately contemplating your own death, and does so not as morbidity but as a technique for seeing the present clearly. It is possibly the single most universal practical instruction in the library.',
  voices: [
    { t: 'jewish', text: 'So teach us to number our days, that we may get us a heart of wisdom.', cite: 'Psalm 90:12' },
    { t: 'buddhist', text: 'All conditioned things are impermanent. When one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering.', cite: 'Dhammapada 277' },

    { t: 'confucian', text: 'While you do not know life, how can you know about death?', cite: 'Analects 11.11' }
  ],
  close: 'Confucius refuses the question, and it is not evasion. Asked about serving the spirits he says: you cannot yet serve people. Asked about death: you do not yet understand life. His position is that speculation about what follows is a way of not attending to what is in front of you, and that the person who has lived well has already answered the question as far as it can be answered. Zhuangzi, told his wife had died, was found drumming on a tub and singing.'
},

{ id: 'silence',
  title: 'The uses of silence',
  question: 'Why does every tradition ask you to stop talking?',
  intro: 'Stillness, sitting, retreat, a day of stopping, a mouth kept shut. The instruction is everywhere, and it is always practical rather than decorative — the claim is not that silence is pleasant but that certain things cannot be perceived through noise, including your own noise.',
  voices: [

    { t: 'taoist', text: 'Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.', cite: 'Tao Te Ching 56' },

  ],
  close: 'The Sabbath is the most radical version, because it is legislated. Not a mood to be cultivated when convenient but a law: one day in seven, everything stops, including for your servants and your animals and the stranger inside your gates. It is the first thing the Hebrew Bible calls holy, and what it makes holy is not a place or an object but an interval of time in which nothing is produced.'
},

{ id: 'stranger',
  title: 'The one who cannot repay you',
  question: 'What is owed to a person outside your circle?',
  intro: 'Reciprocity is easy to justify and nearly universal among social animals. What is striking in these texts is how insistently they push past it — to the stranger, the enemy, the poor, the person from whom nothing can be expected in return. This is where each tradition says something that costs its adherents something.',
  voices: [
    { t: 'jewish', text: 'The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.', cite: 'Leviticus 19:34' },

    { t: 'hindu', text: 'The gift that is given to one from whom no return is expected, at a fit place and time and to a worthy person, that gift is held to be pure.', cite: 'Bhagavad Gita 17.20' },
    { t: 'confucian', text: 'Within the four seas, all are brothers.', cite: 'Analects 12.5' },
    { t: 'taoist', text: 'The sage does not accumulate for himself. The more he does for others, the more he has.', cite: 'Tao Te Ching 81' }
  ],
  close: 'The Levitical command is the one with a reason attached, and the reason is memory: love the stranger, because you were strangers. It grounds the obligation not in the stranger\'s worth, which can be disputed, nor in your own virtue, which can be flattered, but in something that happened to you. It is the oldest argument for hospitality in the West and still the hardest to wriggle out of.'
},

{ id: 'enough',
  title: 'Knowing what is enough',
  question: 'How much is enough, and how would you know?',
  intro: 'Every tradition here is suspicious of accumulation, and none of them is merely being ascetic about it. The argument in each case is practical: that wanting is a state with its own momentum, that it does not terminate when satisfied, and that a person who has not decided in advance what enough looks like will not recognise it on arrival.',
  voices: [
    { t: 'taoist', text: 'He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.', cite: 'Tao Te Ching 46' },

    { t: 'muslim', text: 'Rivalry in worldly increase distracts you, until you come to the graves.', cite: "Qur'an 102:1–2" },
    { t: 'hindu', text: 'Let right deeds be thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.', cite: 'Bhagavad Gita 2.47' },
    { t: 'confucian', text: 'With coarse rice to eat, water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow — I have still joy in the midst of these things.', cite: 'Analects 7.15' }
  ],
  close: 'None of these texts is against wealth as such, which is a modern misreading. The Hebrew Bible treats prosperity as a blessing; the Qur\'an assumes trade and regulates it; Confucius says that if riches could be properly sought he would seek them. The objection is to a particular relation — being held by what you hold. The Gita puts it most precisely: the problem is not the action or its result, but the grip.'

{ id: 'beginning-again',
  title: 'Beginning again',
  question: 'What happens after you fail?',
  intro: 'Every one of these traditions expects you to fail, builds the expectation into its structure, and provides a route back. This is worth noticing, because the popular impression of religion is of a standard held over people. The texts read more like instructions for recovery than for perfection.',

  ],
  close: 'The Hebrew word is teshuvah, and it does not mean penance. It means turning, or returning — the assumption built into the word is that you were on the path already and can rejoin it, that failure is a departure rather than a disqualification. The Ten Days between the new year and the Day of Atonement exist to give that turn a season. So does Lent, and so does Ramadan. Every one of these calendars has a built-in annual amnesty, on the apparent theory that people need one.'

  title: 'What you actually are',
  question: 'Is there a self, and if so, what is it?',
  intro: 'This is where the library divides most sharply, and the divisions are not a matter of emphasis.
