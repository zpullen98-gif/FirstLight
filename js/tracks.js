/* First Light — the track registry.

   The year was one corpus for a long time: a global Q of 366 entries and a global
   MONTHS of twelve themes, both read directly by Today, the Year, search and the
   Vault. Track switching was half-wired before this file existed — FL.prefs.track
   already namespaced the kept-quote and by-heart keys as `<track>:<m>-<d>`, so a
   reader's vault was ready for a second corpus — but nothing ever swapped the
   corpus itself, and dayEntry() read Q no matter what the preference said.

   This is the swap. Everything that used to read Q or MONTHS now reads trackQ()
   and trackMonths(), so adding a third track is a data file and one entry here.

   LOAD ORDER IS NOT A CONSTRAINT. The corpora are reached through functions rather
   than captured at definition time, so this file may load before or after the data
   files it names without changing anything. */
