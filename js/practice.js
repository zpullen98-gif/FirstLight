/* First Light — the practice engine.

   The artifact's Body chapter was six YouTube embeds. Good ones, but a practice you
   cannot do without a connection is not a practice you can rely on, and the app's
   own text argues that what matters is return rather than intensity.

   So: a breath pacer, interval timers, and written sequences, all of which run with
   no network and no third party. The videos stay as a supplement.

   Everything here is driven by requestAnimationFrame against a wall-clock start
   time, never by counting frames or by setInterval. A backgrounded tab throttles
   timers to once a second or stops them, and a pacer that drifts is worse than no
   pacer — you would be breathing to a rhythm the screen has lost. */
